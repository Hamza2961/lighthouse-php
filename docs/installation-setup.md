You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/lighthouse-php
```

This package relies on the `lighthouse` and `chrome-launcher` js package being available on your system. In most cases you can accomplish this by issues these commands in your project.

```bash
npm install lighthouse
npm install chrome-launcher
```
